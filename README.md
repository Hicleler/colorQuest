### How to play ###
Use your finger to move the tiles below the gray line. When two tiles touch, they merge into one and the numbers will add up! Number more than 16 will be looped back to count from 1. A green border will appear each time a tile matches the one in the front of the board. If you manage to show 4 matched tiles on the board at a time, you win.
