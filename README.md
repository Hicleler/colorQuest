### How to play ###
Use your finger to move the tiles. When two tiles touch, they merge into one! The numbers will add up and number more than 16 will be subtracted by 16. A green border will appear each time a tile matches the one in the front of the board. If you manage to show 4 matched tiles on the board at a time, you win.
